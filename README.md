# Tech stacks 

* Use PHP with Laravel as a framework, Laragon for local development.
    * Use MySQL as a database.
    * Use artisan and postman for testing code.

* Use OVH for production.
    * Use FileZilla and phpMyAdmin for production development.
    * I chose OVH because it's GDPR compartible.
    * I separated Frontend and Backend for enchancing security.
